Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! 
This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in October.

## Project news

### The last 1.7.7 translations are available!

The catalog of new translations has recently been added to Crowdin. 
This means that the completion rate for all projects has slightly decreased. Some projects that used to be 100% translated and validated are no longer complete. 

Translators, proofreaders... your project needs you! Feel free to take a look at the new translations and help it reach 100%! 

### A new project has been opened: Sorani (Kurdish)

A new language project has been opened on Crowdin following the request of [Fatah Barzangy](https://crowdin.com/profile/fb.nanosoft)... It is the Sorani (Kurdish) project. Do not hesitate to get involved! :blush:

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers
 
Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! 

So lots of love to the dedicated: [okom3pom](https://crowdin.com/profile/okom3pom), [Kian Yuan](https://crowdin.com/profile/kianjuan), [dev.niebla](https://crowdin.com/profile/dev.niebla), [bbbenjie](https://crowdin.com/profile/bbbenjie), [René Paolozzi](https://crowdin.com/profile/repa69), [Athiwat Klauythong](https://crowdin.com/profile/ahteewat123), [Axel Rousseau](https://crowdin.com/profile/axel584), [danielshapiro9](https://crowdin.com/profile/danielshapiro9).

See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully translated languages
 
At the end of October 2020, PrestaShop 1.7.7 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **6 languages**:
 
| **Czech** | **English** | Spanish | Portuguese, Brazil |
| Slovak | Swedish | 

This is less than in September, but this is not surprising as new translations have been added this month.
 
## Languages with the best evolution
 
In comparison with September 2020, the following languages had the best progress thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Azerbaijani** (+9% to reach 37% translated)
* **French, Belgium** (+8% to reach 8% translated)
* **Esperanto** (+6% to reach 19% approved)

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of October 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (98% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Esperanto** (59% translated vs 19% validated). (But we can observe an increase of 6% since last month! Congratulations! :fire:)
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (51% translated vs 11% validated).
* **Galician** (98% translated vs 58% validated).
* **Spanish, Mexico** (91% translated vs 56% validated).

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of [jmcoget](https://crowdin.com/profile/jmcoget)'s request regarding the French (Belgium) project. 

He is looking for volunteers to discuss and help him on the project, and in particular proofreaders to validate the strings. If you are Belgian, and you want to join him, do not hesitate to join the French, Belgium project on Crowdin!
 
![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2020/11/build-crowdin-proofreading-oct20.png)
 
If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!
 
If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:
