## General messages

Dear developers,

Thanks to the contributors who tested the Release Candidate, a few bugs have been identified in the build that was published [three weeks ago](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-rc-release/).

These bugs have been fixed, so the road is now open to deliver PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 stable release. A new build has been created and delivered to QA team to run the tests campaign. Once it's verified, if no blocking bug is found, we will be able to release it!
