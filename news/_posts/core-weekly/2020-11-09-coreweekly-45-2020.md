## General messages

Dear developers,

Have you tested [**PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 Release Candidate 1**](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-rc-release/)?

If you currently have little time and you feel you cannot help us making sure this Release Candidate is the right one, know that _every effort counts_.

- If you are a developer who builds modules or themes, you can simply run them on this version
- If you are a merchant, you can simply open the new Back Office Order pages and see if it looks alright to you
- If you are a developer who builds and sells shops, you can simply install this version and start customizing it as you usually do

As written by [Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law), "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" (Linus's law). So the more people can test this Release Candidate, the better it will be!

And if you find out that everything is working well, feel free to tell the world! Comment on this article, share on social networks... we also need this kind of feedback! ðŸ˜‰


Reminder: on October 18th, if no critical or major regression has been reported, _PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 will be delivered as a stable version._
